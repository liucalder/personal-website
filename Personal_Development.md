**How to Become a Straight-A Student**  
Cal Newport

Key points in introduction and Part 1

- You don’t need to study all day and give little free time to yourself.  
    
- Avoid pseudo studying — studying with a lot of distractions will make the amount of work you get done less. 

- Make a list and calendar to manage your time effectively.

- Simply, when planning out your day, be reasonable.

Thinking about being a “Straight-A Student”, one may think about studying long hours and not giving themselves enough time to do what they really want. However, this is not the case. In the book “How to Become a Straight-A Student” by author Cal Newport, he gives us some examples of interviews in which he discussed study habits with high-achieving students. Through these interviews, he picked out the ones where students studied *efficiently*, and got more answers through that. In the beginning of part one, he introduces the idea of pseudo studying. He further communicates this idea with the formula “work accomplished \= time spent x intensity of focus”. For example, if work intensity was on a scale of 1 to 10, and say you had a work intensity of 5\. Simply deriving the formula, you would have to work about double the amount of someone with an intensity of 10 working in bursts. From what I have read in this section, I have not been doing work with maximum intensity often, and often pseudo-studying in retrospect. To start implementing these, I can work in bursts. For example, 1 hour after each meal with an intensity of 10 would be better than 6 hours with an intensity of 5\. This applies to my coding work, physics, math, and after summer ends all my school work. 

Managing your own time will not take much time out of the day. With this basic but powerful time management method, it will be easy to keep track of your day. For this, you will need a calendar and a notebook. With the notebook, every time something that you need to remember comes up, jot it down. For example, “Writing assignment for English class is due next wednesday”. Using these notes, at the start of the next day, organize how you want to finish these, and be realistic. Working on an assignment from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. isn’t possible when you planned to meet with your friends at 6 p.m. I have not been using these concepts in my own life, however it is easy to see how this could be beneficial, so I will start doing this.

Key points in part 1 \- step 2

- Keep a work progress journal

- Make sure you’re eating and drinking enough to fuel your body \- don’t skip meals

- Find free hours on certain days to only do work

- Choose days to do more work than normal

In Step 2 of Part 1 in the book “How to Become a Straight-A Student”, the author interviews multiple of these Straight-A students about procrastination. They answered that sometimes, you can’t beat procrastination, but you can beat the urge to procrastinate. This means that there will always be work that you don’t want to do, and gives you “Battle Plans'' to counter these. One of these plans includes keeping a work progress journal to track your productivity. To put this battle plan into action, get a small spiral notebook, putting all the tasks of the day you need to do. If you did all the tasks in the day, simply put down “all completed”, and if not, put a note and a reason as to why you did not finish. 

Another one of the battle plans is to make sure you’re eating well, because you procrastinate more when you have low energy. To make sure you have good nutrition, always drink water, don’t skip meals, monitor your caffeine intake, and treat food as a source of energy instead of satisfaction. Another battle plan is to choose hard days, which are days that you dedicate to doing more work with less distractions. As said by a straight-A student, “Occasionally I end up setting aside one full day where I just lock myself in my room with some food and grind through it.” I have not been using the battle plans in the above two paragraphs to the fullest extent, but it is easy to put into action. For example, I could list out everything I need to do tomorrow in a notebook, and just do it. 

Key points in Part 1- Step 3

- Choose the time that you study effectively, the earlier the better.

- Choose where to study well, this will give you less distractions and a more focused environment.

- Know how long to study, in order to ensure you don’t overwork yourself.

In step 3 of part 1 in the book “How to Become a Straight-A Student”, the questions asked are when you should study, where to study, and how long to study. The first question asked is “When should you study?” The answer to this question is early during the day. The nighttime is full of distractions, and after around 7a-8 p.m., your attention starts to decrease because your body is getting ready to sleep. Try to squeeze in work in small breaks you have, and you will be surprised as to how much work it will get done when it all adds up. As quoted by a straight-A student, “I try to take a book I need to read along with me all the time, in case some free time pops up while I’m doing something else.” The second question asked in this part is “Where should you study?” The answer to this question is a quiet, isolated place with minimal distractions. Some good places to do this are at the library and in your room. Having people that can interrupt you while you are studying is never good, since you can easily lose your focus. 

The third and final question asked in this part of the book is “How long should you study?” The answer to this question is no more than an hour without a break. In cognitive scientific research, it shows that to maximize how much information you retain, you should study for around 50 minutes and take a break. After 2 hours, retention goes down to just 30%. When I study, I often try to study in isolation which is one of the points this book makes. However, as suggested by the text, studying in the morning and in periods of free time is more effective than at night. These three questions answered are all very useful in increasing productivity, and it is pretty straightforward as to how to get going with them.

Key points in Part 2 \- Step 1 

- Studying does not have to be reviewing your notes and reading over and over again, there are much more effective ways to study.

- In non-technical courses (Those you don’t have to memorize formulas in), get the big picture, and use the question evidence conclusion structure.

- In technical courses, do as many sample problems as possible. 

In part 2 of the book “How to Become a Straight-A Student”, the author teaches us how to do well in quizzes and exams. Many people tend to review notes over and over again, leading to pseudo-studying as aforementioned in the first part of the book, leading to fatigue and low-intensity marathons. In step one of the book, the author gives you tips on how to take smart notes. He splits these notes into two types of courses, technical and non-technical. Technical courses are courses like math, physics, computer science, engineering etc. where you use formulas and logic. Non-technical courses are courses like English and history where it is largely reading, writing, and understanding. To take smart notes in non-technical courses, identify the big idea, then compare and contrast various aspects of the topic. Use the question evidence conclusion structure to format your notes, to understand as much of the material as possible.

In technical courses, the key is doing as many sample problems as possible. This gives you a lot of different ways to practice, making you understand the formulas more to do better on tests. A test can be split into two categories, quizzes and exams. Exams are tests with 15% or more of your grade, and studying for these should be prioritized. Quizzes on the other hand, are tests worth less than 15% of your grade, and tests worth less than 5% are *tiny quizzes*, which can be taken lighter than an exam. When I’m in class taking notes, I usually just write down a bunch of stuff while looking at the screen which I never end up reviewing, and the note taking strategies the author shows gives you more insight into what you’re learning, allowing you to memorize your notes better. From the previous three days, I have noticed that doing work earlier does give you more free time later in the day. The ideas demonstrated in this part of the book will apply more when I go back to school and have to take notes.

Key points in Part 2 \- Step 2

- Constantly work on assignments whenever you have time

- Know what you should read, what you should skim, and what you should skip entirely

- Work in groups when you can, and think about problems on the go.

In Part 2 \- Step 2 of the book “How to Become a Straight-A Student”, the author gives us tips on how to work on assignments effectively. The first tip he gives is to constantly work on assignments. When someone gets an assignment they may cram it up until the day before the due date, which may be simple but it does not do the trick most of the time. The only result will be poor quality work. By doing little bits of assignments every chance you get, you will slowly be able to finish most or even the entire assignment when the due date rolls around, saving you a lot of time and energy. After this, he talks about reading assignments and knowing what to read, what to skim, and what to skip. He puts it into a basic hierarchy system, which is:

Readings that make an argument \- most important  
Readings that describe an event or person \- less important  
Readings that provide context \- least important

When reading, always be taking smart notes as described in the previous part. In a lot of courses, there is usually one or two favored sources that are used commonly in class material and should be read. These sources often contain information in a condensed form that you need to know. In the third and final tip, the author advises us to always work with a group when collaboration is allowed. However, when doing question sets with a group, you should at least partially or have an idea of how each question should be answered. If you’re doing a question by yourself, you may first look at the question, try to answer it in the most obvious possible way, and then put your books down. The author mentions how this may seem counterintuitive, but now that you know the question and why it is tricky, you can think of different solutions to solve it passively. All of these parts combined together can work very well, especially when you think deeper into it. For example, if you don’t pseudo study while also knowing what readings are prioritized, you can get your work much faster than say pseudo studying while reading every single reading.

**What I will do to get work done faster.**

**Keep a work progress journal**

To keep a work progress journal, I am going to have a small spiral notebook and write a date on top of it. To know what work I need to get done on that day, write a day on the top of the notebook and a list of what I have to get done that day. Then, whenever I finish something, I cross it out. If I didn’t finish anything in the list, write a quick explanation on why I didn’t do it and put it onto the next pages. This will help motivate me, and this example is metaphorically compared to a drill sergeant yelling at you to finish your work. This is effective when you are delaying your work day by day. To do this, I will use the small notebook given to me during my graduation to keep track of all the work I need to get done/get done on that day.

**Work in isolation**

To get work done faster, I will study with higher intensity for a lower amount of time. In the book, the author emphasizes to you a formula which is **work done \= time spent x intensity of work**. To know what work to get done, start with clear priorities of what you want to do with the calendar mentioned in the first part of the book. Minimizing distractions is a vital aspect in getting work done faster, because if you work with a bunch of distractions all around you, it will be very hard to focus on a single task for a long time. This is why working in isolation is so important, because when you have people around you all the time, they can easily get you distracted. When doing work, I will focus very hard for about 1 hour and take a break, because after about an hour, your brain starts to retain less and less information about what you’re doing.

**Do work early in the morning**

To maximize how much work you get done and also your free time, you should do your work early in the morning or as early as possible. This is because as the day passes, you will get more and more tired, especially after 7 p.m. The more tired you get, the less motivated you are to get work done resulting in a lower intensity of work. Another advantage of doing work early is getting more free time. When you finish all your work as early as possible you basically have the rest of the day to yourself to do whatever you want. To do this, I will wake up around 6 a.m. to 7 a.m and get all my work done by noon or early in the afternoon, while also keeping in mind my intensity of work and how many distractions I have.

**Part 2 \- Step 3 Key points and summary:**

- Putting the previous steps in part 2 into use, studying should not be painful.

- Define the challenge in the test, what does your teacher want you to know?

- Build a good study guide for non-technical courses, and construct a big problem set for technical courses.

- Add technical questions to your problem sets to know whether you are just memorizing it or really understand it.

The previous steps in part 2 were taking smart notes and knowing how to do assignments. When you know how to do this, studying should not take a long time as you will know a lot of the things you need to do beforehand. One of the main parts of studying effectively is organizing your resources. First, define what the challenge is in the test. What will the teacher test you on based on the previous material? As explained by Christine from Harvard, “It’s helpful to know in advance what kind of knowledge will be asked for on the exam—IDs, dates, broad syntheses of the texts’ major arguments?” The author lists a few major questions to ask when you are preparing for a test:

- Which lectures and reading assignments (or problem sets) are

fair game?

- What type of questions will there be, and how many of each?

- Is the exam open note or open book?

- For a technical class, will formulas be provided or do they need

to be memorized?

- How much time will be available? Does the professor expect

the exam to be easy to complete during the test period or a  
Challenge?

To do well on a test, you always have to have a good study guide. The author recommends building a study guide with the smart notes you’ve taken for non-technical courses. Conversely, for technical courses, build a “Mega-Problem set” to apply your knowledge over and over. Lastly, you should underlie your study guide with technical questions, and as quoted by the author, “It’s important that you add these technical explanation questions in addition to your regular sample problems, since they will reveal whether or not you *understand* the underlying concepts or if you’ve just memorized the steps for some particular problems.” To apply this knowledge in real life, the five questions listed by the author to ask before a test are all crucial to adapt to the way you study.  
**Key points from part 2 \-  Step 3**

- Use the quiz and recall method

- Know how to use the quiz and recall method for both technical and non-technical courses

- Memorize over time, not all at once

As expected, in this part of the book, the author is starting to tell you not only the methods he gave you, but how to put them into effect. The quiz and recall method is a method where you not only re-read your notes over and over, but also write about it or speak about it, acting as if you were a teacher. This method works because instead of passively recalling information (e.g. reading your notes), this method requires you to actively recall information which you have learned. In non-technical courses, the quiz and recall method is simple. As said in previous chapters, you should have taken smart notes using the question-evidence-conclusion format. For very broad and general questions, you can split these into smaller ones about each chapter you’re learning. On the other hand, when there is many small questions, you can combine some of them to make them bigger questions.

To use the quiz and recall method for technical courses, refer back to your mega problem set’s underlying question. Answer this question out loud, as it is better for memorization. As Lydia from Dartmouth explains, ““I find that walking around and saying things out loud commits them to memory in a spectacular way.” When writing questions for your review, you should also write some in your own words. “I don’t just read the material,” explains Worasom, a straight-A student from Brown. “I write the important equations and concepts out by hand.” For some things in courses like dates, formulas, and people, it will be hard to memorize them all at once. You should slowly memorize these for a little each day to fully ingrain it in your head. To use these methods, you should first get good at the methods from the previous steps making these very easy and useful to use.

- A lot of dopamine isn't necessarily bad, because it makes it easier to engage in “sustained effort”  
    
- If the first thing you do when you wake up is drain all your dopamine, you will not have enough to engage in sustained effort, and if you engage in low dopamine actions, you will still release dopamine.   
    
- Add new things to your goal, to get more motivation

- Think about the subconscious value of studying vs gaming by doing a conscious value assessment.  
    
- Play the tape thru to the end, meaning that you think about the consequences of your actions. e.g. if you start gaming at 8 a.m. instead of studying, what happens?

- doubt is the opposite of discipline, but resolve is the opposite of doubt, for example, if you're not sure if you want to do something, it will make you less disciplined as you are not 100% committed to it.  
    
- Start with a small resolve, like not eating ice cream. After a while of doing that (Dr. K recommends about 30 days), you can move to harder but better resolves that are more useful in *your* daily life.

I found the example of squeezing a lemon in the video “The Secret Behind Resisting Dopamine” very interesting as it is a great analogy between our dopamine receptors and a lemon getting squeezed. Something else I found interesting was how the opposite of discipline was doubt, and how the opposite of doubt was “resolve”. Dr. K tells us how to use this to our benefit by making smaller “resolves” first, then gradually making them bigger until it is very useful for you. These “resolves” are what builds the foundation for discipline. 

Some things in this that I found relevant to my own life is the dopamine in the morning. When I think back on it it really does feel like a lemon that is my dopamine receptors. If I wake up in the morning and the first thing I do is use social media or games, it will give me much less motivation for the rest of the day. Almost everything mentioned in the videos can be put into practice immediately. One resolve that I will make is waking up at 7 am every morning no matter what.

**Brain Rot Is Holding You Back \- HealthyGamerGG \- Key points \+ Summary**

\- The mind will rust when you don't use it enough

\- Filter your perception, instead of letting everything get to your mind, let only certain things you want get into your mind.

\- Think about what the truth is to an event vs your reaction to it

\- Every time your mind says "I am...", try your best to ignore it, because it will impact your actions

\- People with brain rot live reactively, what other people do determines your motivation. (e.g. someone is better than you, so you just quit)

The phrase that Dr. K uses in this video, “The mind doesn't wear out with use, it actually rusts with disuse” emphasizes the necessity of maintaining a sharp mind. Just as physical muscles may weaken if you don’t exercise, your brain will also become more and more foggy as you use it too little. The main idea behind this video is controlling what you let go inside your brain. If you listen to everything and let it get inside your head, you will believe everything that anyone says resulting. The term used by Dr. K, “Brain rot,” is when the mind becomes foggy from not filtering our perceptions. People with brain rot will allow their minds to become “colonized” by negative perceptions of other people on them. This will result in a reactive lifestyle, meaning they filter nothing that goes into their mind and react to everything more than they should. 

To use this knowledge to my advantage, I will filter what comes into my brain. When you scroll through the internet, you carelessly let everything that you see get into your brain, resulting in too much information coming in with no useful output that can be generated using that information. As said by Charles R. Swindoll, "Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it.” This quote connects very well with the last note, showing how the way you react is vital to how your life is impacted by what other people say. Next, whenever my brain says “I am…” I will ignore it, since these only show up because I have been affected by what other people are saying, which is what I don’t want as stated above. Combined together, these will allow for my brain to become sharper and have less of the “brain fog” that makes me work less productive and have less motivation to do what I want to do.

**How to Become a Straight-A Student Part 2 \- Step 5, Key Points and Summary:**

\- Ask questions about anything you don't understand, they can easily show up on your test.

\- Write down anything that you may have not paid attention to or skipped in your notes and make sure to note that you don't understand. Don't leave them just sitting in your notes but rather act on it so you can fully understand the material

\- Make a habit of talking to the professor or teacher after class to clarify on anything you don't understand

\- If there are any review sessions before the exam, go to them. Jot down everything from your notes you're still unsure about then get them answered.

\- Ask other people about things you don't know, sharing knowledge is always good.

A lot of the time, students will go to a test thinking they are all prepared. They breeze through the first few questions, but suddenly get stumped by a question that they never studied for. If this happens on an exam, each question can easily be worth a lot of your grade so you need to prevent this from happening. The main thing that you should do is simply ask. One thing you can do is stay after a lesson to ask the teacher or professor questions, for further clarification on something you might not be sure of. Make sure that you are going to study sessions whenever there are any available, and jot down things you may have skipped or are blurry about and simply just ask to get them answered. Something else that may be useful is asking a classmate. As James from Dartmouth says, “Talk with other people about the topic.” Send them an e-mail or ask them in the hallway, they probably know something that you don’t.

The concept presented by the author in this step is straightforward but very useful. He calls this “Investing in Academic Disaster Insurance.” What you have to do is nothing more than a simple strategy of eliminating any questions you have. To utilize these strategies into my own life, I should always watch out for anything that may be unclear, and act on them. Being too afraid to ask will only set me back. Gaining any knowledge you can is very important to consistently do well on tests. As Christine from Harvard says, “By skipping a point made in a lecture, you’re gambling with the possibility of being truly in the dark on the exam.” A few topics may slip past you here and there, and when you think you understand all the big topics, these small things may get to you. In conclusion, whenever you are unclear about something, you should ask whoever knows about it.

**How to Become a Straight-A Student Part 2 \- Step 6, Key Points and Summary:**

\- Do a quick skim through the entire test first to get a general idea of what topics are covered.

\- Put time limits for yourself on each question.

\- Answer the questions from easiest to hardest, not in order.

\- For essay questions, don't go on and ramble but instead make an outline of how you will write it first.

\- Always check your answers at the end of the test, and use up all the time you have.

In the earlier parts of this book, the author teaches us all about where to study, how to study, when to study, etc. However, after putting everything you’ve studied for into account, he now tells us how to do the test itself. The first thing that should be done when you get a test is to do a quick skim through the test. This allows you to get a general overview of how difficult the test is, what topics are covered, and you can almost answer 2 questions at once subconsciously. The next point that he makes is putting time limits on each question. To do this, subtract 10 minutes from the length of the test and divide it by the amount of questions. Next, answer the questions in order from easiest to hardest, so at the end, the hardest questions are the only thing you have to solve and you don’t have to worry about all the others. Using the 10 minutes that you subtracted from the time, check all your answers thoroughly to make sure that you didn’t miss any. Use up all the time that you have to ensure that you use up every minute to its fullest potential.

To apply this to my own life, I can use some of these during real tests and see which ideas work best for me. For example, when budgeting my time, I will experiment with how long I need to check my answers for each subject, and I can make it a little shorter or a little longer depending on my previous experiences. On a bigger exam I might have an essay question, and the idea of making a quick outline will definitely benefit me. Next, I should answer the questions from easiest to hardest because it will give me more time later on to do the harder questions. Overall, there are many ways to take a test, but the ideas mentioned in this chapter are very easy to use and definitely effective when taking the test.q

**A Teenagers Guide To The Deep Life \- Cal Newport (Video)**

\- Don't get too specific about what you want to be at such an early age.

\- Focus on your academics. Make sure to be organized and study hard.

\- Have physical discipline, do sports, exercise, etc.

\- Have mental discipline. Don't spend all your time doing random things that don't benefit you, (Gaming, scrolling through social media, etc.)

This video dives into the significance of discipline in one's life. A 16 year old asks Cal Newport the question, “Do you have any recommendations for my 16-year-old son who is now reading your books and listening to your podcasts? He would like to create multiple streams of income and enjoy a deeply satisfying life?” Newport tells him to not become too specific of what he wants at such an early age. The most important thing to focus on at this age is academics. Study hard, be organized, and go to a good college/university to get the knowledge needed to do what you want to do in life. It’s easy to become trapped in social media, gaming, and other distracting things. Although these may give you pleasure in the moment, they will only negatively impact you in the long run when you want to achieve your goals or pursue personal development. You should develop a mind that intentionally focuses on self-development and academics at an early age. 

I will apply this to my own life by consistently using this advice. Focusing on my academics is the best thing I can do for myself for the long term, because I can pursue a career I want to do later if I gain the knowledge I need now. Since he is also the author of “How to Become a Straight-A Student,” a lot of the things he says in that book also apply to this. For physical discipline, there is a gym in the basement with lots of exercise equipment I can use. Physical discipline is important because you have to learn to push yourself to your limits, and the easiest way to do that is through sports and exercise. Having mental discipline is also very important because if I am just wasting precious time scrolling through social media or gaming all day it will affect my brain and make me less focused on important tasks because of brain rot. The key takeaways from this video are to focus on academics, don’t be too specific of what you want as a teen as there are so many more opportunities, and have physical and mental discipline.

**Review of Parts 1 and 2 \- How to Become a Straight-A Student**

In parts 1 and 2 of the book “How to Become a Straight-A Student”, the other covers multiple key points. Some of the key points covered include how to manage your time wisely, where to study for maximum efficiency, when to study for the best results, etc. He mentions technical and non-technical courses and how to study in each of them. In technical courses (courses that require logic and formulas like math, physics, etc.), make a mega problem set and answer as many questions as possible. In non-technical courses, get the big picture then write notes using the question-evidence-conclusion structure. One of the “formulas” he gives is “work accomplished \= time spent x intensity of focus”, meaning that if you study very hard for a shorter period of time, you will get more work done than if you were using a lot more time but using less intensity, or how hard you study. Another piece of advice he gives is to study or read whenever you have some free time, in order to get your work done as early as possible. E.g. If you have a 30 minute break between classes, use that time to study, so you have more time later instead of using the 30 minutes being unproductive.

To apply this to my own life, I can write out a list of what is most effective through trial and error. Since every piece of advice he gives is from a variety of different perspectives, there are a lot of different things I can do to use them. He gives a lot of advice in the book but I can pick what is best for myself and use those. Making a notebook and managing your time effectively is the best way to do all these. Furthermore, I can pick some of the other pieces of advice such as doing assignments whenever I have time, taking smart notes, and making effective study guides for both technical and non-technical courses.

**How Years Of Gaming Affects Your Brain \- HealthyGamerGG \- Key points \+ Summary**

-   
- Dopamine gives you happiness (short term), but serotonin makes you feel overall confidence and well being (long term).

- Gaming shuts off the blood flow to places in the brain that make you feel fear and anxiety.

- Video games shut off negative emotions and bring pleasure, making people more prone to doing things that they usually wouldn’t.

- Break your problems into two parts. Keep splitting your main goal into two different parts until there is something that you can do right now and what you end up with is a bunch of small tasks that will sum up to a “main quest”, similar to a video game.

He gives an example of how when you go whitewater rafting, your muscles will be very sore the next day, but you will feel amazing on the inside because you feel a sense of accomplishment. For gamers, sitting at their screens all day will have an imbalance, so they may feel happy in the short term but not in the long term. Video games will make you feel less negative emotions and bring pleasure as addictive things do, making you not learn your lesson even when you know you should. This is because negative emotions are the primary drive for making you learn from your mistakes. For example, if you need to study for a test but procrastinate until the day before the test because you were gaming. You will know that’s bad for you, but instead you just do it over and over again because video games take away your negative emotions of what happened last time you procrastinated. 

To apply what was learned in this video into my own life, I can do more activities in nature like taking walks, playing sports, etc. One example in the video is when someone wanted to go free diving, they went on a walk while holding their breath for as long as possible, and the amount of time they could hold their breath gradually increased, giving a serotonin boost to them. Although this isn’t something that you would usually tell other people, it will feel like much more of an accomplishment to you than, say, being good at a video game. At the end of the video, he also tells us how to accomplish our goals. What he advises is to make a big goal, then split it into two parts, then split the first part into another two parts, and go on and on until there is something that you can do in five minutes. For example, you wanted to get a job. You can split this into applying for a job and getting accepted and interviewed. Then, split applying for a job into making a resume and submitting your resume. For making a resume, first you need a template then fill out this template. You can easily find a template in 5 minutes so you can just start with that.

**How to Become a Straight-A Student Part 3 \- Step 1, Key Points and Summary:**

- College essays take a lot more thinking and research than high school ones.

- Find a titillating topic before the assignment starts

- Make the structure for the paper first.

- The more detailed the assignment is, the more detailed you have to think.

In this part of the book, the author teaches you how to write essays and papers. There are a lot of different varieties of writing assignments, which include research papers and critical analysis essays. A research paper requires you to find a topic and write on it, while a critical analysis essay usually requires you to analyze a reading. In step one of this procedure, the author recommends for you to find a titillating topic first. If you have trouble finding one, as Chien Wen from Dartmouth says: “Approach your professor with some ideas you have and let him recommend some appropriate readings.” This will help you because the professor will know what he expects for a paper, and he will give you topics that he knows do well. You should skim through previous assignments or textbooks to find a general topic you're interested in.

To apply this, when I go back to school I can use what I learn in part 3 of the book for essays. In the next parts of the chapter, I will learn more about how to write papers and this will help my writing skills in the future. To do this, I can start coming up with a titillating topic before the essay is assigned to me.

**How to Enhance Performance & Learning by Applying a Growth Mindset**

- Growth mindset is the idea that we can change our minds, and grow from experience

- A mindset is a mental frame or lens that selectively organizes and encodes information

- Neuroplasticity is when your brain changes through experiences

- Feedback that you get based on performance leads you down a path that is very different from feedback that you get based on effort

- These forms of feedback get integrated into our beliefs into what we think is possible. However, you can change these beliefs by giving yourself feedback

- A research study showed three different groups of children. One group got intelligence feedback, one got effort feedback, and another got no feedback. The intelligence group when given a different problem set only chose the ones that they knew, the effort group tried the harder problems.

- The kids who got complimented on their effort continued to try the harder problems and did far better than the ones who were praised on intelligence who only kept trying the easier problems.

- The people in the control group (no feedback) performed about the same the entire time.

- The people in the intelligence groups performance went down significantly

- The people in the effort groups performance went up significantly

- The intelligence group tended to lie more about their score, because they wanted to appear better than they actually did.

- A fixed mindset is believing that intelligence is fixed and cannot be improved.

- Anyone can improve their intelligence using dedicated effort and growth mindset to their advantage

- To apply a growth mindset, you can start shifting your narrative, or the voice you’re talking to yourself in, to tell yourself that you put a lot of effort into something  
    
- When doing this, you should tell yourself the truth, and how you got your skills.

- Telling yourself that you failed something because x so you should do y to improve it will help your effort label, instead of just saying “I failed x so I shouldn’t try again”

- Analyze every time when you got something incorrectly, and look at those through the lens of verbs


In this episode, Andrew Huberman talks about the importance of a growth mindset, especially in people with developing brains. In the first part of this episode, he talks about what a growth mindset is. Essentially, it is the idea that you can improve your intelligence and it is not fixed. A mindset is defined in the episode as “A mental frame or lens that selectively organizes and encodes information”. He talks about a research paper that investigates three different groups. One group gets feedback based on their intelligence on a question, another gets feedback based on the effort they put into the question, and the control group gets no feedback at all. The kids who got complimented on their effort continued to try the harder problems, while the kids who got praised on their intelligence tried the easier problem because they knew they would get praised no matter how difficult the problem was. These topics can apply to my own life because if I praise myself based on how much I tried instead of how well I did, it will push me to do harder things and not just keep doing things that mom and dad would praise me for. In a survey in 1996, 85% of people believed that intelligence is fixed. This is contrasted by “Neuroplasticity”, defined as the ability for the nervous system to change its abilities in response to external factors by reorganizing its structures and functions. In the study, it shows that the people in the effort group consistently did significantly better, the intelligence group did significantly worse, and the control group which got no feedback had their results stay the same. This shows that if I apply the concept of neuroplasticity to my own mind and develop a growth mindset, the results I see on the daily will see significant improvements.

**How to Become a Straight-A Student Part 3 \- Step 2, Key Points and Summary:**

- To find a thesis for critical analysis essays, go through previous reading notes and lecture notes.

- For a research paper, start general, then move one layer deep, meaning you keep diving deeper into the topic

- Look at the sources for the general topic you’re researching, and approach those

- Know if your thesis can support a good paper

In this part of “How to Become a Straight-A Student”, the author gives us steps on how to find a thesis statement. He gives us tips on how to efficiently find thesis statements from both research papers and critical analysis essays. Firstly, for research papers, he tells us to “Start general, then move one layer deep.” This means that you should start with a basic topic, then go deeper and find sources. As Chris from Dartmouth says, “If I’m doing a paper on the Kurds in Turkey, for example, I get a recently published general history on this topic.” For critical analysis essays, the solution is to review your reading notes and lecture notes that relate to the topic, and that should give you an idea of how you are going to answer the prompt. Knowing whether or not your thesis can support a quality research paper is important. As Christine from Harvard says, “It’s provocative, nuanced, direct, and inclusive.” She also says that an essay should not be simple, but it should include room for ambiguity and unresolved issues. 

To apply this to my own life, I can use the key points from both parts 1 and 2 of step 3 in this book for essays. First, I will find an interesting topic to dive deeper in. For research papers, I can start on a basic idea, then go deeper as I research more to find interesting ideas. For example, if I had a research paper on William Shakespeare, I could first find a biography of him, then split this biography into two different parts, etc. For critical analysis essays, I will go through previous notes that I took using smart note taking strategies, and see what kinds of topics I can go to from there. For example, if I had a critical analysis essay on how a character in a book seeks adventure, I will go through the notes I took previously from that book to spot any times where the character actively went on adventures, or quotes proving that the character pursues adventure.

08/01/2024

➡️00:35:41 Tool: Timing, Intelligence vs. Effort Praise & Performance 

\- After an exam, if you praise them on their performance, they will do worse on the next exam.

\- Before an exam, if you praise them on their persistence and dedication, they will do much better.

\- It doesn't matter when you give the praise, but it has to be correctly attached, not a lie.

➡️00:40:08 Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset: Failure & Performance

\- The fixed mindset thinks that since they didn't do good this time, they will just never do good.

In a research study, one group had an intelligence mindset and another had an effort mindset:

\- The "error signal" in their brains was larger in a person with an intelligence mindset vs an effort mindset

\- When people with a growth mindset are told they are wrong, they try to understand why they got it wrong.

\- A fixed mindset is more likely to give up, and have a lower effort. They focus on the emotional response instead of seeing why they got something wrong.

➡️00:50:28 Tool: Shift from Fixed Mindset

\- To shift to a growth mindset, we have to acknowledge an error and focus on it.

\- When faced with results you don't like, understand these errors from a less emotional stance and a more cognitive stance.

➡️00:55:30 Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset

\- To get more motivated, there is another mindset. This is called "Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset"

\- How we think about stress can help us benefit from it.

\- Learning that stress can enhance performance can help you improve performance even on things that don't stress someone a lot.

➡️01:05:53 How Stress Can Enhance Performance

\- To enhance your performance using stress you should shift your mind away from the usual negative state to the positive state.

\- When you develop this mindset, you can plug this into the growth mindset to benefit from both mindsets at once.

➡️01:13:21 Growth Mindset \+ Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset & Performance

\- Students taught about the stress-is-Enhancing mindset perform much better.

\- Anticipatory stress is reduced when you are educated about growth mindset and Stress is Enhancing mindset

In this part of the video, Huberman sums up growth mindsets vs fixed mindsets and dives into "Stress-is-Enhancing" Mindsets. In a growth mindset, people believe that their results are directly correlated with the effort they put in, instead of how intelligent they are. Another benefit of a growth mindset is that if you're told that you're wrong, you will have a less emotional response and a more cognitive response. (E.g. You will find out WHY you got something wrong instead of being disappointed that you got it wrong and not learning from your mistakes). If you change your beliefs about stress, it can actually help benefit you instead of having your mind all over the place and not focusing at all. By telling people about the stress mindset, growth mindset, or both, they will improve their performance significantly against control groups. To apply this to my own life, I can use both of these mindsets. For a growth mindset, I will put in more effort and practice learning from my mistakes more than simply trying to get the desired result. For example, if I got a math problem wrong, I will see why I got that question wrong and how I can do better next time on similar questions, instead of just taking the failure and moving on. This will enhance my performance greatly because I will not only be embracing my mistakes, but also learning from them so I can make less mistakes on future questions. For the stress-is-enhancing mindset, I will tell myself that the stress I'm experiencing is beneficial for me rather than detrimental. For example, if I was delivering a presentation and was nervous/stressed, I can use the stress to my benefit by simply telling myself that this response from my brain will benefit my performance on the presentation. To use both of these to my advantage, when I stumble in my talking, I will use my growth mindset to have a positive response to this rather than a negative.

**How to Become a Straight-A Student Part 3 \- Step 3, Key Points and Summary:**

- Discuss the targeted topic and thesis with your professor

- Ask different questions, like:  
  Is my idea appropriate for the assignment?

	Does it cover too much?  
	Is it too simple?

- If it’s a critical analysis essay, that is a good sign and you can go on. For a research paper, further explain some of the sources you plan to use and the professor may have some additional sources to suggest.

In this part of the book “How to Become a Straight-A Student”, the author explains that if you followed the previous steps on writing an essay, you’re on the right track. However, there is one more step that is very important as well. When you have everything pretty much planned out, go to your professor by scheduling a time or go during office hours to ask about your topic and thesis. Ask the following questions: 

**Is my idea appropriate for the assignment?**  
	**Does it cover too much?**  
	**Is it too simple?**

If a professor deems your thesis and topic appropriate, you can move on with a critical analysis essay. For a research paper, you can ask more questions about your sources, and the professor will likely give more sources for you to explore. This is a crucial step that many students skip, even though it only takes 10-20 minutes and can be the difference between outstanding work and a dud.

To apply this step to my own life, I can do this:

FIrst, I can find a topic for the essay by using Step 1 of this part of the book. Then, to make a thesis, it depends on the type of essay you’re writing. For a research paper, I will start basic, and move one layer deep. For a critical analysis essay, I will look through my previous notes and make one out of that. After I have my topic and thesis, I will go to the teacher during office hours and ask them questions about my topic and thesis. For example, if I had a critical analysis essay on a book, I will go through my notes to make a thesis statement, and then I will go to the teacher to ask whether the thesis statement is appropriate, and if it’s too simple or too broad

**How to Enhance Performance & Learning by Applying a Growth Mindset**

➡️01:20:36 Reframing Stress

In this experiment, there was a 30 minute lesson on the growth/stress mindset:

- It asks you to recall a time when you experienced stress, and what that stress was related to.  
    
- It tells you that difficulty, struggle, and frustration when you're learning something are not signs that you've reached your limits, they're signs that you're expanding your limits

- The growth/stress mindset led to a 40% improvement in self regard, 14% improvement in passing courses that were challenging

➡️01:25:45 Tool 1: Student & Teacher Mindset

- If both the teacher can adopt the stress mindset and the growth mindset, that’s the best case scenario.


➡️01:28:17 Tool 2: Effort Praise/Feedback: Verbs not Labels

- You should use verb labels for yourself and others, especially when there is a success.


➡️01:31:24 Tool 3: Errors & Seeking Help

- The best way to analyze our errors is to get help, to understand why they didn’t perform well.

➡️01:32:58 Tool 4: Self-Teaching & Growth Mindset 

- Take a piece of paper, and write a letter as if you’re writing a letter to a person learning about growth mindset, stress-is-enhancing mindset, and write all about what it is.


➡️01:34:35 Tool 5: Reframe “Mind is Like a Muscle” Analogy 

- The mind is kind of like a muscle in a way, but he reframes it as more like your mind endures stress during the learning process, and then that’s what teaches us to get better.

.

In the last part of the video “How to Enhance Performance & Learning by Applying a Growth Mindset,” Huberman gives us another research experiment on the stress mindset, and gives us five different tools to use to use everything else learned in this video. The first tool is having the student and teacher both having a growth/stress mindset. This is because the teacher and the student both know the students abilities are not fixed and can be improved. Another key point in the video is using verbs, and not labels. For example, if someone did well on a math test, you should say “You really put a lot of effort into studying for the math test,” instead of “You did very well on the math test, you are very smart.” In tool 3, he tells us that when analyzing our errors, we should seek help. This is what solidifies a growth mindset because you always want to learn more from someone who can teach you. After this, in the next tool, he tells us what to do if tool 1 doesn’t work because your teacher doesn’t have a growth mindset. You should take a piece of paper and write down all you know about the growth mindset and the stress-is-enhancing mindset, and pretend it is to someone that is just starting to learn about it. This will help you because it gives you the sense that you’re your own teacher, and can help improve your own performance. To apply all of these tools to my own life, I can teach dad, who is one of my teachers right now about the growth mindset and stress-is-enhancing mindset. To do this, I can show him the studies and all of the research that it is backed up by. I can seek help whenever I need in order to further improve my growth mindset. For example, if I was stuck on a math problem or a physics problem in school I can ask dad to help me understand it instead of just trying to figure it out all by myself.

**You Haven’t Experienced the Payoff of the Compound Effect**

- The compound effect is getting huge benefits from making small choices.

- Changes won’t feel significant in the moment, but they build towards a huge difference.

- A lot of people will quit after seeing little results. This is because the results in the meantime don’t seem significant enough to keep going.

- He gives us the formula “Small, Smart Choices \+ Consistency \+ Time \= RADICAL DIFFERENCE”


  
**The Magic Penny**

- The magic penny is a penny that doubles in value every day.

- The choice is either 3 million dollars or a penny that doubles in value every single day for 30 days.

- After 5 days, you will only have 16 cents, and after 10 days you will only have 5.12$. On day 20, this will become $5,243. However on day 30, this will become over 10 million dollars instead of the 3 million dollars that you could have originally taken.

- This example represents the formula above of consistency \+ time.

**Three Friends**

- This example gives you 3 friends. They all have the same income, and grew up in similar conditions.

- One friend makes good choices, cutting 125 calories per day, reading 10 pages of a book per day, and walking a couple thousand extra steps. The other friend doesn’t do anything that’s bad or anything that’s good, he just stays like that. The third friend makes some poor choices like eating unhealthy and watching tv all day.

- There are very little changes in the first few months, or even years. It is only after around 2 years that these small changes are making a big difference. 

- The person who cut just 125 calories a day has now saved 117,500 calories, or around 33.5 pounds\!

**The Ripple Effect**

- The ripple effect is basically how one small bad choice can turn into something very bad over time.

- He gives the example of Brad, making some muffins from a recipe he saw on tv. He makes these muffins, and all his family loves it. He starts making more sweets, and all of the extra sugar makes him groggy in the morning and unable to sleep at night. This decreases his productivity, and his boss is dissatisfied. This leads to more and more bad things, but he likely doesn’t know that just the sweets were the cause of it.

- Instead of realizing how his own bad choices are affecting his life, he blames it on other people.

**Success, Old School**

- You have to know that you have to keep working consistently even without seeing results to start seeing the payoff.

- Once you start becoming successful, you have to keep putting in the same work ethic and not take the success for granted. Don’t destroy the thing that made you successful.

- One example is if a restaurant had very nice owners and staff, and people started liking the atmosphere and going there more, causing the restaurant to be very successful. However, the workers gave up this because they were already so successful, but that was the downfall of the business and they went out of business in 18 months.

**Microwave Mentality**

- The microwave mentality is when you seek fast results, and believe that overnight success is achievable.

- The solution to a problem is rarely just a quick fix.

- 

**Write out a few excuses you might be clinging to (e.g.,**  
**not smart enough, no experience, wrong upbringing,**  
**don’t have the education, etc.). Decide to make up in hard**  
**work and personal development to outcompete anyone—**  
**including your old self.**

Some excuses I might be clinging to are: 

- This will take too long, I don’t want to do this.

- This is too hard for me to understand, so I will not even try.

- I will leave this to the last minute because it should be quick.

To fix these one by one, I will see what the actual reason for these excuses are. The reason behind most of them is because I don’t feel like doing something. Making excuses to myself is bad because it will stop me from achieving a goal. For the excuse that something takes too long, I will remind myself that if I work at a high intensity, it will be done in less time than I think, and I can have free time without guilt. For the second excuse, I can remember to use a growth mindset, and put the most amount of effort into understanding and doing something as possible. If I implement these steps instead of making excuses, this can be counted as a small step into making a big change.

**Be Scott—Write out the half-dozen small, seemingly**  
**inconsequential steps you can take every day that can take**  
**your life in a completely new and positive direction.**

Some seemingly inconsequential steps I can do to take my life in a new direction is:

- Using the bike for just 20-30 minutes a day with full effort

- Going outside more.

- Drink more water to feel fuller and eat less calories.

These habits can help me a lot over the long run. Biking for 20-30 minutes with full effort may burn a few hundred calories, which will add up a lot over time just as said in the book. I may not see the results of doing these instantly, but the changes will be drastic if I just keep it up and keep doing it. Drinking more water can also help me feel better throughout the day, instead of being dehydrated all the time from sitting at my desk.

**Don’t be Brad—Write down the small, seemingly**  
**inconsequential actions you can stop doing that might be**  
**compounding your results downward.**

The small steps that I can change that may be compounding my results downwards are:

- Waking up too late

- Leaving things to the last minute

Waking up too late is a reason for not doing as much work as I can. For example, if I woke up at 7 a.m., I can get 90 minutes more work done than if I woke up at 8:30 a.m. This may not seem like too much in a single day, but this will add up over time, thus the compound effect, and all the extra knowledge I can obtain in this 90 minutes will help me a lot over time. Leaving things to the last minute is also something that I can fix, for example if I started doing something 2 days before it was due, the work will be better quality than if I did it 1 day before it was due, because I am less rushed to finish it.

**List a few areas, skills, or outcomes where you have you**  
**been most successful in the past. Consider whether you**  
**could be taking those for granted and are not continuing**  
**to improve, and are therefore in jeopardy of having that**  
**complacency lead to future failure.**

One of the skills that I have been successful with is math. However, I have to keep practicing otherwise I may lose my skill and go even with the curriculum level work that I’m doing in my grade or even go lower, making math go from easy to hard in school with the result being lack of practice, and taking my skills for granted. I have to continue doing it to help build up my skills. Another thing that I have been successful with is chinese. I do reading and writing on most days with it and continuing to develop these skills can bring me further into understanding this language. If I stop practicing, I may forget how to write some words or what some words mean.
